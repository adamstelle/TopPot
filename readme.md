Basic Program Structure:
1. Create constructor object for all store branches, with parameters for all key user inputs (location, the range of hourly foot traffic, the % of people entering the store, and # of donuts sold per person)
2. Within the provided range, calculate random hourly values of foot traffic per location.
3. Multiply hourly foot traffic by the % entered and avg. # of donuts sold to generate # of total sales per hour, and store these values in an array.
4. Display the number of donuts sold per hour per branch and total number in the browser & console log.
